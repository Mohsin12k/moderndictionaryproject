# ðŸ“š Interactive Dictionary App

An interactive dictionary web application that allows users to search for words, view their meanings, examples, and pronunciation, with smooth animations and a clean user interface.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Animated Search Bar**  
  - Initially, only a magnifying glass icon is shown.  
  - On click, the magnifying glass disappears and is replaced by an animated close (X) button.  
  - An input box with two buttons appears:  
    - **Search** button  
    - **Clear** button  

- **Search Functionality**  
  - Type a word into the input box and click **Search** or press **Enter**.  
  - The results drop down, showing:
    - Word
    - Meanings
    - Examples (if available)  
      - If no example exists: `"Sorry, example is not found."`
  - If the word is not found, API fails, or input is empty, an appropriate **error message** is displayed under the input box.

- **Results Section**  
  - Includes two additional buttons:  
    - **Play Sound**: Pronounces the word  
    - **Close**: Hides the result section  
  - Below the input box, a **changing message** appears each time you search, e.g.:  
    - `"Search words meanings above!"`
    - `"Ready to explore another word?"`
    - `"Type a word and discover its meaning!"`
